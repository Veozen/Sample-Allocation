# Sample-Allocation

Implements optimal sample allocation for stratified simple random sampling using the method described by Tommy Wright "A Simple Method of Exact Optimal Sample Allocation 
under Stratification with Any Mixed Constraint Patterns"
https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2014/adrm/rrs2014-07.html

Also implement an extension to Bernoulli sampling.
